## Why I Love It
- The transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader is **heart breaking** and **complex** but at the same time it is my favorite scene since Anakin Skywalker is my favorite character along side what he becomes at the end of the movie.
- Epic lightsaber battles, such as:
  - Obi-Wan Kenobi vs. Anakin Skywalker
  - Yoda vs. Emperor Palpatine
- Stunning visuals and choreography for its time.
- The score by **John Williams**—especially *Battle of the Heroes* and *Anakin's Betrayal* enhances the drama and stakes.
